# Public Assets

## Profile Photo

To add your profile photo:

1. Place your photo in this directory (`/public/`)
2. Name it `mehul-photo.jpg` (or update the path in `components/ProfilePhoto.tsx`)
3. Recommended format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
4. Recommended size: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)

The photo will automatically appear on the About page. If the image file doesn't exist, a placeholder will be shown.

## Other Assets

You can add other static assets (images, icons, etc.) to this directory and reference them with `/filename.ext` in your components.
